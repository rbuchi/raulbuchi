      <h2>Hi there.</h2>
      <p class="me-text">I was born in the last century, more precisely, in 1976. Grandson of Swiss, son of Brazilians engaged in changing the world. I was born in Brasília, the capital of everything that could happen at that time.</p>
      <p class="me-text">It was the pinnacle of portable cameras. The peak of the military government in Brazil. Colors were beginning to dominate the television world. Punk Rock started its movement and its first idols (but my parents preferred the
        Beatles), it
        would still take two years for women to be able to vote in some cantons in Switzerland.</p>
      <p class="me-text">But I was a kid, I don't remember anything from that time.</p>
      <p class="me-text">Then the world began to prepare for the magical 80's. The colors, the tacky, the bad music and the Goonies' film. I went through this decade playing Playmobil, playing ball in the square and riding a bicycle.</p>
      <p class="me-text">Nothing worried me, but on the counter, I always had the last issue of the National Geographic Magazine, bringing beautiful photos and impressive articles. Also, my father's and my mother's bookshelf, capable of making any
        military man in
        the dictatorship go mad with anger, was beginning to catch my attention.</p>
      <p class="me-text">The 90s were energetic. A lot of grunge, a lot of national rock, a lot of mountains and a lot of philosophy. Also, in the middle of the decade, I started college in psychology, wearing a nice plaid flannel shirt.</p>
      <p class="me-text">The 2000s made everything absolutely digital. They opened the digital multimodality of the contemporary world to 640kb. They shaped the world we have today.</p>
      <p class="me-text">Head chat, photography and my passion for Switzerland. The perfect mix for this digital space.</p>

        <h3>My Website About Psychology</h3>
        <p class="description-text">First of all, is Psychology. I work since 2001 as a Cognitive-Behavior Therapist and this brilliant and objective Psychology Branche has always surprised me.

          This experience I share through the blog, sharing small and smart tips to the day-by-day self-development. Sometimes in Portuguese and English, sometimes in only one of these languages. A good example of themes brought in this blog is the
          process of choice (or “decision making”, as we call it in cognitive psychology).</p>

        <h3>My Website About Photography</h3>
        <p class="description-text">I have, and I try to present in this site, a wide photographic repertoire of the Atlantic Forest in the Serra do Mar made by us. Specifically, in the region of Paraná – Brazil, it was more than 20 years of HIking
          along the most beautiful
          and impressive tracks of the mountain range. Absolutely unique mountains, rivers, and forests fill the bulk of this photographic collection. But small fishing boats on the coast, churches in small towns and cities, and my beloved Curitiba,
          with its 3 million inhabitants forming a
          sea of contrasts, also present themselves, thus closing a cycle of 42 years of life in Brazil, with 22 years of photography. In a serious relationship with Switzerland since 2017, I have been hiking through the plains, rivers, millennial
          cities, castles and especially, but really especially the Swiss lakes, forests, and mountains, I present the photographic compositions of this imaginary paradise. Whether alone, accompanied by the wife, the daughter, or with the stepson,
          everybody with the camera on the neck and backpack, we invite you to meet the Great Focal portfolio, click the links and follow our blog.</p>

        <h3>My Website About Immigration to Switzerland</h3>
        <p class="description-text">Switzerland is a country made up of free cantons. That’s to say, every canton is practically an independent country. In fact, the federal government has power only on some strategic points with, currency
          regulation, army, and civil
          defense. Even health and transportation are not run by the federal government, but by private landowners, the federal government alone regulates these structures, but for example, each canton is free to operate public transportation as it
          wishes.
          Even education that is public and of the highest quality is regulated by the cantons
          Switzerland is the most liberal of all the countries of the world, that is to say, that it is the country with less intervention of the state in the economy. That is, taxes subsidize very little, and the direct costs to the taxpayer are
          higher, but freely chosen. In the canton where I live, Sant Gallen, the tax is more or less 11%, in Zürich, 7.75%. It was reduced in 2018 because of the fiscal surplus.</p>
